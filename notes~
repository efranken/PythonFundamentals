python fundamentals

python uses duck typing meaning that the suitability of an object type
is only detected at run time

cpython is the standard implementation
ironpy, jpy, pypy are others

------------------------------
Getting started with python 3
------------------------------

repl
--------------------
read input, evaluate input, print input, loop back to top
_ refers to the last referenced variable
ctrl z exits the repl

whitespaces
--------------------
python uses indentation rather than curly braces to demarc code
four spaces does it, tabs are not needed over spaces
do not mix tabs and spaces


all lines that end with a colon will denote that the line below has an indentation

importing from repl
--------------------
import math
help(math)
space to go through all types

for instance, if we want factorial from math
	math.factorial(var)

for multiple references, or better looking code
	from math import factorial
	factorial(var)

for even shorter
	from math import factorial as fac
	fac(var)

if you want only an integer, use // instead of /
	this will return a full number

integers aren't an issue, only limited by memory in computer

to get the length of an integer, convert it to a string
	looks like len(str(var)))
	to figure out digits of fac(10), len(str(fac(10)))
